# 42-Cursus-Libft

## Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. However, when working on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in the project guidelines.
